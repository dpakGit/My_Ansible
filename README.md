**Ansible, Salt Stack, Chef, Puppet**

Ansible, Salt Stack, Chef, and Puppet are **IT automation frameworks**.

These frameworks automate many traditional system administrators' processes. Each framework uses a series of configuration data files -- usually YAML or XML -- that are evaluated by an executable. 

The configuration data files specify a sequence of actions to take to configure a system. The actions are then run by the executable. The executable differs in language between the systems -- Ansible and Salt Stack are Python based and Chef is Ruby.  This workflow is similar to running ad-hoc shell scripts but offers a more structured and refined experience through the respective platforms ecosystems. These tools are what will bring enable the automation needed to achieve CI/CD.


Ansible is an open-source IT automation engine that simplifies and streamlines various IT tasks, including provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration.

It is known for its simplicity, **agentless architecture, and use of human-readable YAML for defining automation tasks**.

#### Key Features and Concepts:

**Agentless Architecture:** Unlike some other automation tools, Ansible does not require agents to be installed on managed nodes. It connects to remote machines via standard protocols like SSH for Linux/Unix and WinRM for Windows, making it easy to deploy and manage.
YAML Playbooks: Automation tasks in Ansible are defined in human-readable YAML files called playbooks. These playbooks describe the desired state of systems and the actions to be performed, such as installing software, configuring services, or deploying applications.
Modules: Ansible provides a vast library of modules, which are small programs that execute specific tasks on managed nodes. These modules abstract away the complexities of interacting with different systems and applications, offering a consistent interface for automation.
Inventories: Ansible uses inventories to define the hosts or groups of hosts that it will manage. These can be static files or dynamically generated, allowing for flexible management of infrastructure.
Idempotence: Ansible operations are designed to be idempotent, meaning that applying a playbook multiple times will result in the same system state without causing unintended side effects.
Orchestration: Ansible can orchestrate complex workflows involving multiple systems and services, enabling the automation of multi-tier application deployments and other intricate IT processes.
How Ansible Works:
Control Node: Ansible runs from a central control node, which can be any machine with Ansible installed.
Inventory: The control node uses an inventory file to identify the target hosts (managed nodes) that need to be automated.
Playbooks: Playbooks written in YAML describe the automation tasks to be executed on the managed nodes.
Modules: Ansible uses modules to perform specific actions on the managed nodes. When a playbook is executed, Ansible connects to the target hosts (via SSH or WinRM) and pushes the necessary modules to perform the defined tasks.
Execution: The modules are executed on the managed nodes, and the results are reported back to the control node.
Benefits of using Ansible:
Simplicity and Ease of Use: The human-readable YAML syntax and agentless architecture make Ansible relatively easy to learn and use, even for those without extensive programming experience.
Increased Efficiency: Automating repetitive IT tasks significantly reduces manual effort and improves operational efficiency.
Consistency and Reliability: Ansible ensures consistent configurations across systems, reducing human error and improving system reliability.
Scalability: Ansible can manage a large number of systems, making it suitable for organizations of all sizes.
Security: By leveraging standard and secure protocols like SSH, Ansible offers a secure approach to IT automation.
