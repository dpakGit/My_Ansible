Step 1: Installing Ansible on Control Node


bash
sudo su
apt update -y
apt install software-properties-common
add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
apt install ansible -y


Step 2: Configuring Ansible Inventory File

1. Open the inventory file: sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
2. Add IPs of the Managed Nodes in the "hosts" file.

Step 3: Creating a User on Control Node and Managed Nodes

1. Become a root user: sudo su
2. Create a new user: adduser <User-Name> (e.g., adduser devops)
3. Set the password to be the same as the username.
4. Repeat the process on the Managed Nodes.

Step 4: Updating SSHD Config File

1. Open the SSH config file: sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2. Update the following settings:
    - PermitRootLogin yes (around line 42)
    - PublicKeyAuthentication yes (around line 47)
    - PasswordAuthentication yes (around line 66)
3. Repeat the steps on Managed Nodes.

Step 5: Enabling Password Authentication

1. Open the SSH config file: sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/60-cloudimg-settings.conf
2. Update the PasswordAuthentication directive to yes.
3. Restart the SSH service: sudo systemctl restart sshd or sudo service ssh restart

Step 6: Configuring Sudo Privileges for Ansible

1. Open the sudoers file: sudo visudo
2. Add the following line: devops ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
3. This grants the devops user sudo privileges without requiring a password.

Security Implications

- Enabling password authentication can increase the risk of brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.
- Granting NOPASSWD sudo access can be a security risk if not properly managed.
- Ensure that the user or group being granted these privileges is properly secured and monitored.

By following these steps, you can set up Ansible on your control node and managed nodes, and configure the necessary settings for automation.
